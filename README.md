This is a test bed for an idea of a quickly deployable website that could be housed on a local computer instead of on a server.
It will still utilize information that would require access to the internet, in this current format, data from a Web Map Service (WMS)
server.

This example utilizes Leaflet, the Leaflet-Plugin Time Dimension, as well as data from Environment Canada (EC) and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via UCAR.


<h3>Please Note as of the middle of 2018, the Environment Canada WMS server has changed how it responds to data requests and due to that a
  lot of the features I was working with initially no longer work in their current form such as the Time Dimension parts used to get and 
  display a model run worth of data and displaying it. It is my hope that I will be able to find a way around that but at the moment I do not
  have as much free time to investigate how to do that. If you have any ideas please let me know!</h3>

Currently under development for a new release where I'll be moving from Leaflet to OpenLayers implementation for the weather data retrieval
and creating a static offshoot site to host my resume, other work, blog utilizing Jekyll. Hoping to have the addition and transition to 
OpenLayers done by the end of January 2022.
